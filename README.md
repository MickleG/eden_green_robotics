- Read the "EVE_QUICK_START_GUIDE.txt" if you just want to run the robot (for non-software developers)
- Read the "EVE_WS_SOFTWARE_DOCUMENTATION.txt" and "Position Software Documentation.pdf" if you want to explore the software architecture / if you are further developing the robot
- Legacy code lies in the /c++ and /python directories
- Other files in this repo were random testing, ignore unless you're really curious
